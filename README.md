# pico_e-paper
This is a project to build examples for e-paper displays on the Raspberry Pi pico.
Initially, only the Pimoroni pico-inky is supported, but Waveshare displays are in the works.

The first example is a bike computer, pico-bike. It displays the speed, elapsed time, and distance travelled.
Currently it's just a framework with no real sensor for bike movement, just a simulation.
